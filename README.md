Image processing for painting - as in landscapes, portraits etc.

## Specific Images for Oil Painters

When I began oil painting in June 2021 I thought it would be much
easier to juggle the many variables if I had various forms of the
reference that showed specific elements I was concentrating on, such
as just specific values, saturation levels, or hues.  As I could not
find these easily, I simply wrote my own.

## Usage

This utility accepts the name of a file as input, and generates a
lot of output files.  For myself, I put those output files onto my
phone, and use them as necessary at different stages of the painting.

```
ts-node index.ts --image=/path/to/image.ext
```



## The Future

Right now it works for me to generate these many images, put them on my
phone, and flip through them as I paint.  There are no plans as of now
to recode for performance and wrap it up in a UI, though I often consider
the possibility.
